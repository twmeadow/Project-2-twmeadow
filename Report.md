# Project 2 Report

Answer the following prompts directly in this file:
* Information about your dataset (you will be assigned a different grader for this project)
* The time complexities of each method in the Stack and Queue classes
* Justify your use of pointers in the Queue (i.e. the direction of the arrows between the Nodes) as it relates to the complexity of the enqueue and dequeue methods
* An explanation of when and why the 10 objects in the main function changed their order

**Note: Any code that was not authored by yourself or the instructor must be cited in your report. This includes the use of concepts not taught in lecture.**
